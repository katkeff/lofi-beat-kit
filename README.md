# DrumKit

A drumkit/sampler created with HTML, CSS, JS, and Howler.js

Hello! Welcome to my Lofi DrumKit/Sampler. 

The top 3 pads are 3 chords that all work together nicely thanks to music theory :) 

The bottom 3 pads are a kick drum, snare, and hi hat. 

The pads can be ignited by mouse click on web browser, and by tapping the screen on mobile. 

Enjoy!
